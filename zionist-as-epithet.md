“Nothing is creepier than Zionism.” 
</p>
           
This is a sentence that was [tweeted](https://twitter.com/lsarsour/status/263651398250545152?s=20&t=uoBvZ1txQ7KU4VGdCWcyPQ) over 11 years ago (October 31, 2012) by "Palestinian-American activist" Linda Sarsour. Since that distant time, how much has changed? For those of us who are Zionists, where are we in rebutting this bigoted woman's horrendous assertion? 

> Or, do we now have other, more important things to worry about?

Also in her tweet, Ms. Sarsour offered a link to a three-minute video by Remi Kanazi, who [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remi_Kanazi) describes as a "Palestinian-American performance poet, writer and organizer." In his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaGNfKabwfQ), which remains viewable on YouTube for all to see, Kanazi rants there is "nothing normal" about "occupation," or "apartheid, ethnic cleansing, siege, blockade, settler-only roads, bombing water wells, schools, mosques and UN buildings." 

Warming up to his theme - that is, ***shouting into a close-in camera*** - Kenazi proceeds to call Israel a "settler-colonial state with an appropriated culture," and that "Zionism is a real demographic threat, infecting the minds of millions with racism. They were hooded in the south, pushing darker nations into Bantustans, jailing young men in H-Blocks in Northern Ireland." And so on, in a creepily similar vein. 

It's all consistent with an observation made in one of Mr. Kenazi's own [tweets, this one in 2010](https://twitter.com/Remroum/status/26633119248?s=20&t=Lyh2o5KYwMukc087nRU6HQ): "Saying you're a Zionist to me is no different than saying you love the KKK. It's a backward, racist, ideology". 

> All of which is still "up" in the online media space, for all the world to see.

If all this is meant to sound like "performance art", that's because it is. It is also rubbish. Zionism has long been a deeply felt, historical movement of the Jewish people. It's purpose and intent has never wavered: it was always to re-create "Eretz Israel" - an ancestral land brought to life in the modern world by descendants of the tribes that formed an ancient and indestructible people. 

Israel is in fact the culmination of the only viably true indigenous association with Palestine, at least to the extent it is based on a still-extant ethnicity: the Yehudim. This is the land they inhabited until it was  "rebranded" by the Romans to erase its Jewish identity even as they glorified their conquest of it by creating statues of their soldiers parading the menorah they dispossessed from its people, and placed them smack dab in the center of their capital city.

So, while Israel remains a UN member (if only just barely) and --- more importantly --- a highly productive, prosperous and positive member of the world's family of nations, it still gets severely trashed. 

> Because, you know. Jews. 

Yes, it also gets recognized by people and organizations who retain some respect for the heritage of the Jewish people, which centers a "return to Zion" in their worldview. So, notwithstanding endless onslaughts against Zionism across the world, Zionists remain; we have not folded up our tents. In fact, our tents are sturdier because of it.

Those of us who have proven continually supportive of Israel are redeemed by the fact that Israel has proven continually worthy of our support. Especially through the vibrancy of her contributions to a variety of important fields across the life sciences, information technology and modern industry, but also in the "performative," "creative" and "decorative" fields that people of the world have always craved. 

> Innovations abound. 

And yet, in one profoundly sad respect, in some fundamental way nothing has changed. When times get tough, and the world gets more complicated, as it has in recent years, antisemitism starts to stir to life. Soon, it is germinating in the most unlikely places. Eventually, it is growing like topsy in every slab of cracked pavement in a depraved, decrepit city which, perhaps, is not unlike what our modern world has cynically become. 

We can, of course, pull out a few of our own weeds - quotes to buttress our view that far from being evil, Zionism is not much different from other forms of nationalism, based on a fairly basic and recognizable form of national identity. Because it's true.

It was the same kind that swept over the world in the late nineteenth century, and spawned the vast majority of the first wave of nation-states called upon to join the UN upon its formation. These are states where hereditary autocracies and monarchies had largely fallen away (except largely in a ceremonial sense) as the basis for governance or territorial control. Replaced by "nation-states," the UN purported to become the defining mechanism of world governance and international relations. Having a Jewish state in this mix, as a Jewish bubbe might put it, "what could be so terrible?" Well, apparently it was.

Let's borrow from Shlomo Avineri here, in the [introduction to his edited volume](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Mod-Zionism-Avineri/dp/0465043283) "The Making of Modern Zionism: The Intellectual Origins of the Jewish State." In his ever quotable way, he wrote: 

> "Zionism is the product of a complex interaction of European Jewry, Enlightenment ideals, and nationalism in the late-18th and 19th centuries." 

But nowadays, Israel continues to exist, and continues to avoid getting overrun by the tumult and chaos of the pressures of the world-at-large. That is to say nothing of the just as perplexing (if less threatening?) localized non-governance of the "Occupied Palestinian Territories" (to use the legal nomenclature, under a treaty that makes apartheid a world / word crime, rather extrapolating it from historical South Africa), it's all a bit, as the Brits would say, atrocious. 

> So - Israel must be ostracized. 

How is this to be done? Through a particular "academic concept" code word: Settler-Colonialism. This in turn becomes the umbrella rationalization for how Israel is composed of white supremacists who have engaged in the systematic oppression of "people of color." Or more both more precisely and broadly, BIPOC - Black, Indigenous and People of Color. In particular, the "indigenous" Palestinians. Thus, Israel must be called out as the Enemy of the People. Israel is the Sacrificial Lamb. Israel is the Lesser Satan. Israel is the Zionist World HQ on ongoing plots to take over the world. Israel is the point of entry of endless fascination with the not-very-pleasant topic (for not-very-bright people) of Jewish world domination.

The story goes downhill quickly from there. Dozens of examples can be found that things have gone even further, reaching below any formerly-anticipated or -hypothesized "rock bottom." Rather, we now know that we are in a rock bottom freefall, headed toward a universal collective gutter, where vast swathes of the dubious residents of western, or otherwise "civilized," nations are now expressing their absolute delight and joy at what is, in effect, the 21st century of a Nazi rally: the opportunity to take part in the destruction of Israel. They must thereby be - in effect, compelled on account of needing to do so - complicit in the trashing of all, including [Israeli or other Jews who have expressed compassion for Palestine's eventual fate](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/uri-avnery-a-fantasy-friend-of-palestine/). This is necessary now more than other. Anyone standing in the way is also standing hard and fast against this "narrative." 

> And yet. And yet.

Perhaps, we can take some comfort in one true thing: that another, even more powerful narrative remains - one that is not explored in this inquiry. One that is not going anywhere. One that is still what it always was, whether in a desired, physical or transcendant state. One that is called the nation-state of Israel, and the historical reality of Jewish self-determination. Which shall henceforth remain - or, at least for all intents and purposes - forever part of this world, if not the next.
