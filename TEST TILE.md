Jesse Hagopian's January 30 op-ed piece leads one to believe that every last member of our society without sufficient melatonin in their skin is by default a White supremacist. Even if they don't realize it, they are trapped in entrenched, overlapping systems structural racism. Only when they learn to question those systems and shed their privileged "Whiteness" will they finally be able to channel their inner indigeneity and begin to overcome the gloomy story of the American past, a never ending narrative up everyday oppression on their neighbors "of color." 

Hagopian's assessment of American society reflects his deep-seated adherence to Critical Race Theory (CRT), which has taken hold in academia for some time and seeped into popular culture more recently. From the ["1619 project"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_1619_Project) - which claims America's European settlers were motivated to extend their racial dominance, not flee religious intolerance - to books like Ibram Kendi's ["How to be an Antiracist"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Be_an_Antiracist) and Robin Diangelo's "White Fragility," the narrative about our society that is now flodding the zone right now is that white supremacy is diametrically opposed to BIPOC and left to its own devices, that's what the American story ultimately amounts to.  

All well and good, you may think, and long overdue because unlike the song from the hit broadway musical "Avenue Q,"  everyone who cannot say they are "of color" is not just a "little bit racist" by default, they are existentially racist because they revel in, and have no objections to, living in our oppressively racist society.  

Mr. Hagopian's thinking - as well as those leading the group "Washington Ethnic Studies Now," has become deeply entrenched in statewide efforts to revamp K-12 education. Their goal is for such lessons not to be just taught at school, but pounded into the skulls of all of our childrens' minds. No, it won't just be "Black History Month" after they are done. From here on out, we will cram this way of thinking about our country into every subject covered across the school day because we need to raise a new generation that finally learns how to break the shackles of our racist society. 

These educators - if you can call them that, rather than propagandists - feel empowered to do this because in 2019, our legislature passed a bill that directed OSPI to create "ethnic studies materials" so that they could better learn how to be "global citizens in a global society with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures.‚Äù Amazingly, OSPI has been going along with the gag ever since it formed an "advisory committee," at the legislature's behest, to validate and rubber stamp this thinking before it's rolled out. 

defend its usefulness claim the right is on a witch hunt against anyone teaching it to our kids. But curiously, and at the same time, they often also said it's an advanced theory that requires a nuanced understanding of the many "interdisciplinary" forces at work in , thus only suitable for instruction at a very advanced, post-graduate college level) country are now determined to institutionalize it in K-12 education.
